`nuee` is a multivariate data analysis toolkit for Python, with an emphasis on applications in ecology. It uses a synthax similar to [`scikit-learn`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn). Some functions enclose functions from `scikit-learn`, some are forked from [`scikit-bio`](https://github.com/biocore/scikit-bio) or [`ecopy`](https://github.com/Auerilas/ecopy), some are taken from the litterature and some are custom.

The development is paused in favor of a course I'm developing with `R`.

# What does `nuee` mean?
`nuee` comes from the French word *nu√©e*, which means flock. It's a biological metaphor for scatter points.

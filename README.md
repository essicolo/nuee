# `nuee`: Multivariate data analysis toolkit for numerical ecology 

<img src="https://github.com/essicolo/nuee/blob/master/logo.png" width=150px> `nuee` is a library at very early development stage for a multivariate data analysis toolkit for Python, with an emphasis on applications in ecology. It uses a syntax similar to [`scikit-learn`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn). Some functions enclose functions from `scikit-learn`, others are forked from [`scikit-bio`](https://github.com/biocore/scikit-bio) or [`ecopy`](https://github.com/Auerilas/ecopy), and few are custom.

# Relationship with `scikit-bio` and `ecopy`

`nuee` is a tool for research and teaching in mathematical ecology. Since `scikit-bio` is currently not available for Windows, some of its ordination functions were forked rather than wrapped up. Currently, `ecopy` lack some functionalities needed for my teaching and research.

# What does `nuee` mean?
`nuee` comes from the French expression *nuée d'oiseau*, or bird flock.
